# Vim Config

Supports vanilla vim8/vim9 compiled with `+python3`.

Using ssh, which is necessary for fetching submodules, the config can be cloned
directly into your home directory using:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:cjayross/.vim
```

The colorscheme is provided by [vim-one](https://github.com/rakr/vim-one).
